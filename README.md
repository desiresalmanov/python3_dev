# Angular & Quarkus Stack Demo in Cloud Dev Environment

This project was developed as part of a cloud development demo: [Cloud Platform - Modern Development Workflow](https://techblog-upstream.net/blog%20post/2023/04/06/Cloud-Based-Development-Environment.html)

This code repository contains the configuration for a Cloud Dev Environment workspace that includes a three tier app.  The application is composed of an Angular frontend, a Quarkus backend, and a PostgreSQL database for persistence.

There are three main workspace components in this repo:

1. The Devspec - `./devspec`

   Defines the Cloud Dev Environment Workspace:

1. The developer tooling image - `./images`
